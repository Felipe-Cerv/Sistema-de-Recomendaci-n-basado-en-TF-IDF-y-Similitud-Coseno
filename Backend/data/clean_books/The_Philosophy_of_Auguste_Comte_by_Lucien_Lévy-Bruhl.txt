chemical phenomena present characteristics inorganic world come nearest solidarity subsists elements living forms nevertheless chemical phenomena remains irreducible living phenomena chemical yet organic organic longer purely chemical must away heterogenous fictitious grouping called organic chemistry unite different parts according respective nature chemistry proper others biology define
